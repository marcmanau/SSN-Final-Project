# SSN-Final-Project

This repository contains all the folders associated with the final project of SSN. The file Presentaci√≥ SSN Marc Manau.pptx contains the PowerPoint of the presentation, and the folder NPG STM images contains all the files associated with the simulation with SIESTA, Python templates, and structures. 

Inside the folder, the different files had been compressed in zip format to upload them to GitHub. Each file represents one structure. DP-DBBA has only the structure images, while GNR and NPG contain the structures created with VMD, the simulation files, and the local density of states for different STM images. There is also a file of ZGNR, which corresponds to a similar structure of the GNR but with zigzag edges, to evaluate the differences between these two structures. Some files had been erased to fit the archives in the GitHub, but all the important files are in this repository.
